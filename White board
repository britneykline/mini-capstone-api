#array of numbers 
new array minus duplicates 


input x = [1,3,4,6,9]
output [1,3,4,6,9]
y = [6]

p x 

input - [1,3,0,8,0,2]
output - [1,3,8,2,0,0]

evaluate index 0, if not 0 move on to index 1. evaluate through the array until you reach a zero. index 2 is 0, << [] once index 2 is in a new array, evaluate index 3. not 0 so move on to index 4. index 4 is 0, []<<, move to index 5 which is not 0, and is the end of the array. 

at this point we have 2 arrays 
[1,3,8,2]
[0,0]
the next step is to replace the 0's back in to the original array, which would put them at the end. 

output - [1,3,8,2,0,0]

input - []


input - [1,2,2,3,3,4]
output - [2,2,3,3]

starting with index 0, evaluate if index 0 = index 1. they do not. loop through array evaluating index[0] against all other indices. there are no other "1', so we move to index[1]. loop through array to find out if there are any pairs. index[1] and index[2] are a pair. move both to new array. 

input - [1,3,3,4]
new array [2,2]

move on to index[1] and loop through the array to find any pairs. index[1] is a pair and is moved to new array. 

input - [1,4]
new array - [2,2,3,3]

the last number has been evaluated against the first number and does not require an additional loop. 

add all pairs in the array to find if they add to 10. they do, p new array. 


Write a function that takes in an array of numbers, where every number shows up twice except for one, and returns the number that only shows up once.

input - [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,5]
output - 4

starting with index[0] loop through until there is a pair. index[0] and index[1] are a pair, move to new_array.

input - [2,2,3,3,4,5,5]
new_array - [1,1]

index[0] is evaluated against index[1]. it is a pair, and it is moved to new_array. 

input - [3,3,4,5,5]
new_array - [1,1,2,2]

index[0] is evaluated against index[1]. it is a pair, and it is moved to new_array. 

input - [4,5,5]
new_array - [1,1,2,2,3,3]

index[0] is evaluated against index[1]. it is not a pair, move on to index [1].

index[1] is evaluated against index[2], it is a pair, move to new array. 

input - [4]
new_array - [1,1,2,2,3,3,5,5]

p input array [4]
